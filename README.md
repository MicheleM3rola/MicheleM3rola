I am a self-taught Front-End Web Developer working with React but mostly with Next.js.

I have been coding for 3.6 years now, I love learn new Tech, and I am always excited when something new comes up.

I would love to have a chance to start to work in tech, I keep myself update all the time even though my github statistics says the opposite, it is just because I have this bad habit to commit my projects when I have finished :sweat_smile:

I am Quite interested to learn Web 3 and blockchain development, but until I find a job I will just focus on what I have done so far.

I always try to build new projects and learn from any resource possible.

I just Love to Code! :relaxed: :relaxed:
